# ldproxy

*ldproxy* is a Python package for generating pseudo-genotypes that reproduce the linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of real genotype data. It enables the sharing of LD information without exposing individual-level genotypes or transmitting massive LD matrices.

This tool provides a lightweight, privacy-preserving alternative for applications that rely on LD patterns—such as fine-mapping, variant annotation, and simulation—while keeping sensitive data protected.
